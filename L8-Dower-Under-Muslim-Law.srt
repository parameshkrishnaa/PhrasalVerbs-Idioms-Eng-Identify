I welcome you all to, Today’s lecture on “Dower Under Muslim law”.

3
00:00:21,139 --> 00:00:25,976
Dower is one of the important components of marriage under Muslim law.

4
00:00:25,976 --> 00:00:29,128
To understand the institution of Muslim marriage

5
00:00:29,128 --> 00:00:32,711
one must learn the concept of dollar in detail.

6
00:00:32,711 --> 00:00:37,717
Therefore in this lesson we will the discuss following issues relating to dower.

7
00:00:37,717 --> 00:00:43,498
• Definition and Nature of Dower • Kinds of Dower • Fixation of Dower

8
00:00:43,498 --> 00:00:46,216
• And Enforcement of Dower

9
00:00:46,216 --> 00:00:48,554
Definition and Nature of Dower:

10
00:00:48,554 --> 00:00:53,763
Unfortunately, the Islamic concept of Mehar has been widely misunderstood.

11
00:00:53,764 --> 00:00:56,297
Those who are obsessed with the contractual

12
00:00:56,297 --> 00:00:59,040
element in the Muslim concept of marriage,

13
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,914
regard it as “Consideration”.

14
00:01:01,914 --> 00:01:06,151
Those who are more familiar with ‘dowry’ confuse it with the same.

15
00:01:06,151 --> 00:01:10,605
The fact is that Mehar is neither ‘consideration’ nor dowry;

16
00:01:10,605 --> 00:01:13,153
it has a unique position of its own.

17
00:01:13,153 --> 00:01:16,658
To understand the Muslim concept of dower thoroughly

18
00:01:16,658 --> 00:01:17,634
let us go through

19
00:01:17,634 --> 00:01:21,817
some of the definitions of dower by eminent jurists of Islamic law.

20
00:01:21,817 --> 00:01:24,388
According to Tyabji:

21
00:01:24,388 --> 00:01:26,937
“Dower or mehar is a sum that becomes

22
00:01:26,938 --> 00:01:30,876
payable by the husband to the wife on marriage,

23
00:01:30,876 --> 00:01:35,810
either by agreement between the parties or by operation of law.”

24
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:38,658
Sir Abdur Rahim, defines it as,

25
00:01:38,658 --> 00:01:43,441
‘dower is either a sum of money or other form of property

26
00:01:43,441 --> 00:01:46,451
 to which the wife becomes entitled by marriage.

27
00:01:46,451 --> 00:01:52,136
 It is an obligation imposed by law on the husband as a mark of respect for the wife’.

28
00:01:52,136 --> 00:01:54,003
According to Baillie,

29
00:01:54,003 --> 00:01:58,072
‘Dower is not exchange or consideration given by the man

30
00:01:58,072 --> 00:02:00,751
to the woman for entering into the contract;

31
00:02:00,751 --> 00:02:07,500
but an effect to the contract imposed by the law on her husband as a mark of respect

32
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,962
to its subject, the woman.’

33
00:02:09,962 --> 00:02:13,168
Justice Mahmood defines dower as follows:

34
00:02:13,168 --> 00:02:14,856
 “Dower under the Mohammadan law

35
00:02:14,856 --> 00:02:20,076
is a sum of money or other property promised by the husband to be paid or

36
00:02:20,076 --> 00:02:22,926
delivered to the wife in consideration of the marriage,

37
00:02:22,926 --> 00:02:27,723
even where no dower is expressly fixed or mentioned at the marriage ceremony,

38
00:02:27,723 --> 00:02:31,363
the law confers the right of dower upon the wife.”

39
00:02:31,363 --> 00:02:34,401
He further elaborates this point as under: -

40
00:02:34,401 --> 00:02:38,502
“Dower may be regarded as a consideration for connubial intercourse

41
00:02:38,502 --> 00:02:42,605
by way of analogy to the contract or sale.”

42
00:02:42,605 --> 00:02:45,842
This observation is subject to serious doubt, as,

43
00:02:45,842 --> 00:02:48,171
Sir Abdur Rahim correctly points out that;

44
00:02:48,171 --> 00:02:51,806
“It is not a consideration in the modern sense of the term,

45
00:02:51,806 --> 00:02:57,730
but an obligation imposed by the law upon the husband as a mark of respect to the wife.”

46
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:01,383
We know that if dower were a consideration it would always be prompt

47
00:03:01,383 --> 00:03:04,686
and specified; but the law allows deferred dower

48
00:03:04,686 --> 00:03:07,705
which is payable on the dissolution of marriage.

49
00:03:07,705 --> 00:03:12,439
And even when it is not expressly fixed or mentioned at the marriage ceremony,

50
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:15,419
the law confers the right of dower upon the wife.

51
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:22,199
The law provides that dower can be fixed before, at the time of or after the marriage.

52
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:25,825
Dower is, therefore, different from consideration.

53
00:03:25,825 --> 00:03:28,607
It is in fact an effect to the contract

54
00:03:28,607 --> 00:03:30,877
imposed by law on the husband.

55
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,681
In Nasra Begum v. Rijwan Ali,

56
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:37,911
the court held that where there has been an agreement between the parties

57
00:03:37,911 --> 00:03:41,834
at the time of their marriage with regard to the amount of dower

58
00:03:41,834 --> 00:03:44,002
 payable by the husband to the wife;

59
00:03:44,002 --> 00:03:49,657
the payment of such dower amount becomes recoverable under agreement.

60
00:03:49,657 --> 00:03:54,561
We know that the binding character of dower is that it has been divinely ordained.

61
00:03:54,561 --> 00:03:59,382
The true nature of dower can be found in the Holy Quran itself.

62
00:03:59,382 --> 00:04:03,148
Holy Quran uses the word Sudaqah for dower.

63
00:04:03,148 --> 00:04:09,279
Sudaqah is a derivative of Sidiq, which means truth, regularity and friendship.

64
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:13,211
Dower in this Quranic sense is the symbol of truthfulness

65
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:17,200
and regularity of the friendship of husband and the wife.

66
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,930
Dower is to strengthen cooperation between the spouses and add to the dignity of women.

67
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,472
Kinds of dower:

68
00:04:25,472 --> 00:04:29,142
 We know that dower is payable whether the sum has been fixed

69
00:04:29,142 --> 00:04:35,931
at the time of the marriage or not. Thus dower may be either specified or unspecified.

70
00:04:35,931 --> 00:04:41,905
If the dower is specified then, again, it may be asked that when it is payable.

71
00:04:41,905 --> 00:04:45,313
Thus we have the following kinds of dower in Islam.

72
00:04:45,313 --> 00:04:50,550
1) Specified dower 2) Unspecified dower.

73
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:53,210
Specified dower may again be divided into:

74
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:58,592
i) Prompt dower. ii) Deferred dower.

75
00:04:58,592 --> 00:05:00,759
Specified dower :

76
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:04,681
The dower, which the parties to the marriage may fix by stipulation,

77
00:05:04,681 --> 00:05:06,422
is called specified dower.

78
00:05:06,422 --> 00:05:10,353
Usually the dower is fixed at the time of marriage

79
00:05:10,353 --> 00:05:12,884
and the Qazi performing the ceremony

80
00:05:12,884 --> 00:05:15,842
enters the amount in the register;

81
00:05:15,842 --> 00:05:19,271
or else there may be a regular contract called

82
00:05:19,271 --> 00:05:22,392
Kabin-nama with numerous conditions.

83
00:05:22,392 --> 00:05:26,683
The sum may be fixed either at the time of marriage or later.

84
00:05:26,683 --> 00:05:30,615
The amount of dower may be fixed by the father if the son is minor

85
00:05:30,615 --> 00:05:34,106
or of unsound mind and a father’s contract

86
00:05:34,106 --> 00:05:37,752
on behalf of a minor son is binding on the minor.

87
00:05:37,752 --> 00:05:42,203
In the Hanafi School the rule is that the dower as fixed by the father

88
00:05:42,203 --> 00:05:48,126
is binding on the son and the father has no personal liability to pay it.

89
00:05:48,126 --> 00:05:52,386
But among the Shias the rule is that if the son has no means to pay it,

90
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:53,995
the father is liable.

91
00:05:53,995 --> 00:05:58,052
In a case of, SayedSabirHussain v. Farzand Hassan,

92
00:05:58,052 --> 00:06:03,716
a Shia father had made himself surety for the payment of Mehar of his minor son,

93
00:06:03,716 --> 00:06:04,958
thereafter, he died.

94
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:06,351
It was held that

95
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:11,359
the estate left by the deceased was liable for the payment of his son’s dower.

96
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:14,724
Accordingly in this case, each heir was made responsible

97
00:06:14,724 --> 00:06:18,696
for a portion of the wife’s claim in proportion to the share

98
00:06:18,696 --> 00:06:23,260
received by particular heir on distribution of the estate of the deceased.

99
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:28,602
Where the amount has been specified the husband will be compelled to pay whole of it,

100
00:06:28,602 --> 00:06:33,446
however excessive it may seem to the court, having regard to the husband’s means.

101
00:06:33,446 --> 00:06:36,435
Now we know that when dower is specified,

102
00:06:36,435 --> 00:06:41,164
the question arises: At what time and in what proportion is the amount payable.

103
00:06:41,164 --> 00:06:42,895
On this basis

104
00:06:42,895 --> 00:06:47,574
dower has been classified as (i) Prompt and (ii) Deferred.

105
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:48,686
Prompt dower:

106
00:06:49,371 --> 00:06:53,096
 The technical term for prompt dower is Muajjal.

107
00:06:53,096 --> 00:06:56,998
It is derived from a root meaning to hasten, to precede.

108
00:06:56,998 --> 00:07:01,309
The term Muajjal, therefore, means that which has been hastened

109
00:07:01,309 --> 00:07:03,824
or given a priority in point of time.

110
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:05,442
Prompt dower is payable

111
00:07:05,442 --> 00:07:08,513
immediately after the marriage, if demanded by the wife.

112
00:07:08,513 --> 00:07:12,590
The prompt dower may be realised by the wife at any time

113
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:15,553
before or after the consummation of the marriage.

114
00:07:15,553 --> 00:07:20,727
The consummation of marriage or living with the husband is not necessary condition

115
00:07:20,727 --> 00:07:21,790
for claiming it.

116
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:26,064
The demand should be specified and not conditional or ambiguous;

117
00:07:26,064 --> 00:07:32,040
the payment of prompt dower may be postponed until there is an actual demand by the wife.

118
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,207
The wife may refuse to live with her husband and

119
00:07:35,207 --> 00:07:40,882
admit her to sexual intercourse so long as the prompt dower is not paid.

120
00:07:40,882 --> 00:07:44,984
If the husband sues her for restitution of conjugal rights before

121
00:07:44,984 --> 00:07:46,959
sexual intercourse takes place,

122
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:49,141
non-payment of prompt dower

123
00:07:49,141 --> 00:07:53,626
is a complete defence to the suit and the suit will be dismissed.

124
00:07:53,626 --> 00:07:58,969
The heirs of a woman are entitled to it as forming part of her estate,

125
00:07:58,969 --> 00:08:04,155
even though she might not have demanded it from her husband when alive.

126
00:08:04,155 --> 00:08:05,573
Deferred Dower

127
00:08:05,573 --> 00:08:09,787
The deferred dower is payable on the termination of marriage by death or divorce.

128
00:08:09,787 --> 00:08:13,210
It has not become prompt by the demand of the wife

129
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,779
during the continuation of marriage.

130
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:18,597
But if there is any agreement as to the payment of

131
00:08:18,597 --> 00:08:21,764
deferred dower earlier than the dissolution of the marriage,

132
00:08:21,764 --> 00:08:25,200
such an agreement would be valid and binding.

133
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,056
The interest of the wife in the deferred dower

134
00:08:28,056 --> 00:08:29,235
is a vested one

135
00:08:29,235 --> 00:08:30,905
and not a contingent one.

136
00:08:30,905 --> 00:08:35,146
It is not liable to be displaced by the happening of any event,

137
00:08:35,146 --> 00:08:42,035
not even on her own death and as such her heir can claim the money if she dies.

138
00:08:42,035 --> 00:08:44,777
Whether the dower shall be prompt or deferred

139
00:08:44,777 --> 00:08:47,878
is primarily a matter of contract between the parties.

140
00:08:47,878 --> 00:08:50,825
When there is such a contract such portion of dower

141
00:08:50,825 --> 00:08:56,319
as is agreed to be prompt shall be prompt and the rest shall be deferred.

142
00:08:56,319 --> 00:09:00,872
But when it has not been specified, there is a difference of opinion

143
00:09:00,872 --> 00:09:06,627
as to whether the whole of it shall be presumed to be prompt or only a part of it.

144
00:09:06,627 --> 00:09:10,018
Among Shias whole dower is presumed as prompt.

145
00:09:10,018 --> 00:09:14,506
Under Hanafi School of thought whole of the dower may be promptly awarded,

146
00:09:14,506 --> 00:09:17,482
but where the agreement is silent on the question,

147
00:09:17,482 --> 00:09:21,028
the usage of the wives family is the main consideration

148
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:23,881
and in the absence of the proof of custom,

149
00:09:23,881 --> 00:09:28,965
the presumption is that one half is prompt and the other half deferred,

150
00:09:28,965 --> 00:09:33,242
and the proportion may be changed to suit individual cases.

151
00:09:33,242 --> 00:09:34,713
Unspecified Dower

152
00:09:34,713 --> 00:09:41,343
Unspecified dower is that dower not specified at the time of marriage or after divorce.

153
00:09:41,343 --> 00:09:47,314
We know the obligation to pay dower is a legal responsibility on the part of her husband

154
00:09:47,314 --> 00:09:50,831
and is not dependent upon any contract between the parties.

155
00:09:50,831 --> 00:09:55,167
Where the dower is specified, it has to be paid accordingly.

156
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:59,282
But where the dower has not been settled at the time of marriage or after,

157
00:09:59,282 --> 00:10:03,945
what are the principles upon which the amount of dower is to be determined?

158
00:10:04,141 --> 00:10:08,218
The customary or proper dower of woman is to be fixed with reference

159
00:10:08,218 --> 00:10:14,025
to the social position of her father’s family and her own personal qualification.

160
00:10:14,025 --> 00:10:16,529
The Hedaya lays down the importance of the rule

161
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:19,087
that her age, beauty, fortune,

162
00:10:19,087 --> 00:10:22,813
understanding and virtue must be taken into consideration.

163
00:10:22,813 --> 00:10:26,360
The Islamic law, therefore, safeguards the rights of a wife

164
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:33,478
and attempts to ensure her an economic status consonant with her own social standing.

165
00:10:33,478 --> 00:10:37,506
The husband may at any time after marriage increase the dower.

166
00:10:37,506 --> 00:10:41,223
Likewise the wife has the power remitting the whole or

167
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:45,497
a portion of the dower in favour of her husband or his heirs.

168
00:10:45,497 --> 00:10:49,457
Remission of dower is valid even if made without consideration,

169
00:10:49,457 --> 00:10:53,528
provided the wife is a major and of sound mind.

170
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:57,404
In case of Ali v. Mohd, Madras High court

171
00:10:57,404 --> 00:11:00,565
and in Mazmun-nisa v. Sirajuddin,

172
00:11:00,565 --> 00:11:02,437
the High court of Patna

173
00:11:02,437 --> 00:11:04,536
 took the view that for the purposes of

174
00:11:04,536 --> 00:11:07,887
remission of dower the age of majority should be reckoned

175
00:11:07,887 --> 00:11:10,440
with under the Indian Majority Act,

176
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,428
i.e. the wife should have completed the age of eighteen years.

177
00:11:15,428 --> 00:11:17,551
But in Qasim v. Kaniz,

178
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:20,515
the Allahabad High court expressed the opinion

179
00:11:20,515 --> 00:11:24,607
that the age of majority is to be determined under Muslim law.

180
00:11:24,607 --> 00:11:28,625
On a strict interpretation of the provisions of the Indian Majority Act

181
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:31,790
the view of the Allahabad High Court is correct,

182
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:35,609
but socially the better view is that of Patna and Madras High courts.

183
00:11:35,609 --> 00:11:37,800
However, it is to be kept in mind,

184
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,948
the remission of a dower

185
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:42,158
must be made by the wife by her free consent.

186
00:11:42,158 --> 00:11:46,902
The wife has also the power of reducing the amount of dower voluntarily.

187
00:11:46,902 --> 00:11:49,949
The remission of her may also be conditional.

188
00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:53,264
Thus in lieu of dower she may agree to receive annuity.

189
00:11:53,264 --> 00:11:56,916
No acceptance of the remission of dower on the part of her  husband

190
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,292
or his heirs is necessary.

191
00:11:59,292 --> 00:12:00,886
Enforcement of dower:

192
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,887
Now we would see the enforceability of dower.

193
00:12:03,887 --> 00:12:07,836
It may be pointed out at the out set that the claim of the wife or

194
00:12:07,836 --> 00:12:12,202
widow for unpaid portion of dower is an unsecured debt

195
00:12:12,202 --> 00:12:16,342
due to her from her husband or his estate, respectively.

196
00:12:16,342 --> 00:12:20,840
It ranks with unsecured debts and is actionable claim.

197
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,276
During her life time the wife can recover the debt herself

198
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:26,488
from the estate of the deceased.

199
00:12:26,488 --> 00:12:30,797
Prompt dower can be enforced by refusal of conjugal rights.

200
00:12:30,797 --> 00:12:36,006
When the prompt dower is not paid the wife can refuse conjugal rights to the husband

201
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:41,339
and non-payment of the prompt dower is a firm defence against the husband’s suit

202
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:43,420
for restitution of conjugal rights.

203
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,044
Not only this,

204
00:12:45,044 --> 00:12:47,807
if on account of non-payment of dower,

205
00:12:47,807 --> 00:12:52,440
the wife is living separately from her husband; he is bound to maintain her.

206
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:58,323
The wife can also file a suit against the husband for the recovery of the dower debt.

207
00:12:58,323 --> 00:13:04,416
A wife can claim maintenance when living separately for non-payment of prompt Dower.

208
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:08,153
Deferred dower cannot be claimed on demand.

209
00:13:08,153 --> 00:13:11,206
The non-payment of deferred dower by its very nature

210
00:13:11,206 --> 00:13:12,259
cannot confer the right

211
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:15,720
 of refusal on the wife to live with the husband.

212
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,095
Dower can be satisfied from the estate of deceased husband.

213
00:13:20,095 --> 00:13:24,005
As we know that dower is a debt and the widow is entitled

214
00:13:24,005 --> 00:13:26,964
along with other creditors of her deceased husband

215
00:13:26,964 --> 00:13:29,083
to have it satisfied out of his estate.

216
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:33,786
The Supreme Court of India has made following observations about it in the case of,

217
00:13:33,786 --> 00:13:37,615
Kapore Chand v. Kadar Unnissa,

218
00:13:37,615 --> 00:13:42,198
“The wife is like any other creditor of the husband and cannot, therefore,

219
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:47,531
claim priority for the dower debt over other creditors;

220
00:13:47,531 --> 00:13:53,938
The widow’s claim for dower debt has priority over the other claims of the other heirs.

221
00:13:53,938 --> 00:13:57,246
The heirs of the deceased husband are not personally liable

222
00:13:57,246 --> 00:13:58,777
for the dower debt of the widow.

223
00:13:58,777 --> 00:14:01,126
The liability of an heir is to be

224
00:14:01,126 --> 00:14:04,807
measured not by his interest in the estate but

225
00:14:04,807 --> 00:14:08,083
by the assets which come into his hands.”

226
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:11,291
The widow’s right of retention:

227
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:15,681
We know that a widow can claim her dower even after death of her husband

228
00:14:15,681 --> 00:14:16,643
out of his estate.

229
00:14:16,643 --> 00:14:20,040
In this respect a right is given to the widow,

230
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,511
which is known as widow’s right of retention.

231
00:14:23,511 --> 00:14:27,843
Literally speaking the right of retention is the act of withholding

232
00:14:27,843 --> 00:14:31,756
what one has in his hands by virtue of some right,

233
00:14:31,756 --> 00:14:33,990
as where a creditor

234
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:37,826
pays his own claim out of the debtor’s property

235
00:14:37,826 --> 00:14:42,678
that comes into his hands as representative of the debtor.

236
00:14:42,678 --> 00:14:44,842
Similarly the Muslim law gives the widow,

237
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:50,070
whose dower remains unpaid a special right to enforce her demand called as

238
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,080
“The Widow’s right of retention”.

239
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:57,668
This right subsists until her dower is paid off either by husband’s heirs

240
00:14:57,668 --> 00:15:03,252
or is satisfied from the usufruct of the property that she holds.

241
00:15:03,252 --> 00:15:06,023
Once she loses possession of her husband’s estate,

242
00:15:06,023 --> 00:15:12,425
she loses her special right and is in no better position than an unsecured creditor.

243
00:15:12,425 --> 00:15:17,220
Until it is paid she has a right to retain possession of the property

244
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,669
of which she has lawfully obtained possession.

245
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:23,936
The widow’s possession of her deceased husband’s estate is considered

246
00:15:23,936 --> 00:15:26,294
to be lawfully held in lieu of dower

247
00:15:26,294 --> 00:15:30,911
where the Mahr-nama provides for it or where she has been put into

248
00:15:30,911 --> 00:15:34,583
such possession by her husband in lifetime

249
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:37,617
or by his heirs after death.

250
00:15:37,617 --> 00:15:41,670
When the widow is already in possession of such property it is presumed

251
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,390
that it was lawfully obtained.

252
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:47,620
So far as the nature of widow’s right of retention is concerned

253
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:51,041
the following facts are to be taken into consideration.

254
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:55,672
1) Widow does not acquire any title to such property.

255
00:15:55,672 --> 00:16:00,708
The widow’s right to retain the possession of the property in lieu of her dower is

256
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:06,243
not in the nature of regular charge mortgage or lien.

257
00:16:06,243 --> 00:16:11,751
It is in essence a personal right as against heirs and creditors of the husband

258
00:16:11,751 --> 00:16:13,097
to enforce her right.

259
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:21,005
2) The widow is responsible to other heirs, as she has to render accounts to them.

260
00:16:21,005 --> 00:16:25,219
She is entitled to some reasonable compensation not only for the labour

261
00:16:25,219 --> 00:16:26,649
and responsibility

262
00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:32,178
imposed upon her for the proper management of the estate but also for bearing to

263
00:16:32,178 --> 00:16:34,507
enforce her right of the dower debt

264
00:16:34,507 --> 00:16:41,128
and such compensation is in the form of interest on the principal amount of the dower.

265
00:16:41,128 --> 00:16:45,509
3) A widow cannot alienate such property.

266
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:51,616
The right of retention does not give the right to alienate property by sale,mortgage,

267
00:16:51,616 --> 00:16:55,779
gift or otherwise for the satisfaction of her dower debt.

268
00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:58,384
4) Heritability.

269
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:01,681
 The widow’s right of retention is capable of descending to the heirs

270
00:17:01,682 --> 00:17:03,348
of the widow on her death.

271
00:17:03,348 --> 00:17:08,550
There was a diversity of judicial opinion as to whether the right to retain possession

272
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:13,092
of the property by a widow in lieu of dower was heritable.

273
00:17:13,092 --> 00:17:18,355
But the conflict was finally resolved by the Supreme Court by holding that the

274
00:17:18,355 --> 00:17:20,608
right to hold possession is heritable

275
00:17:20,608 --> 00:17:22,426
This was held in

276
00:17:22,426 --> 00:17:25,321
Kapoorchand v Kadar-un-nisa.

277
00:17:25,383 --> 00:17:28,882
5)Transferability of the right.

278
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:33,533
So far as the widow is concerned she has a right to assign her dower debt,

279
00:17:33,533 --> 00:17:38,167
but it is unsettled whether the right to hold and retain possession of her husband’s

280
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:41,842
estate till dower is paid, is transferable.

281
00:17:41,842 --> 00:17:47,023
One view is that the right to hold and retain possession of the property being a

282
00:17:47,023 --> 00:17:49,301
personal right cannot be transferred.

283
00:17:49,331 --> 00:17:53,912
This view has been followed in, Abdul Samad v. Alim-ud-din.

284
00:17:53,912 --> 00:17:58,590
The other view is that the right to hold and retain the possession of the property

285
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:03,851
as a security for the dower debt is property and therefore, transferable.

286
00:18:03,851 --> 00:18:07,948
The widow’s right of retention when extinguishes:

287
00:18:07,948 --> 00:18:10,711
The right is extinguished in following cases:

288
00:18:10,711 --> 00:18:14,486
1) When the widow voluntarily gives up the possession,

289
00:18:14,486 --> 00:18:17,220
which she once held in lieu of dower.

290
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:22,723
2) When the widow delivers possession of the property to third person.

291
00:18:22,723 --> 00:18:27,037
3) When the dower debt, in respect of which the right is exercised,

292
00:18:27,037 --> 00:18:30,311
is satisfied from the usufruct of the property.

293
00:18:30,311 --> 00:18:36,625
4) When the dower debt in respect of which the right is exercised is satisfied by payment,

294
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:39,005
by the heirs of the deceased.

295
00:18:39,005 --> 00:18:41,383
With these words, I conclude the Lecture.

296
00:18:41,383 --> 00:18:42,765
Thank you very much.
